description: A star is a self luminous body. Earth is not self luminous in the visible
  radiation range. Antineutrinos generated by the negative beta decay of radioactive
  elements within the Earth, reach the surface of the Earth because of little interaction
  with terrestrial matter. Thus, the Earth star is emanating antineutrino radiation
  by itself, without any reference to the other celestial bodies. (Image by Dr. P.
  Ila and Dr. P. Jagam of NORM Group Organization. Used with permission.)
